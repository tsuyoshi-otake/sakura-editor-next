# P4 Window Adapter Guidance

`CEditWnd` and child HWND classes apply workbench snapshots and forward native
events. They do not own editor, command, configuration, profile, storage,
extension, or backend truth.

Multi-group/window, split, drag/drop, sidebar/panel movement, DPI changes, and
focus restoration must update the workbench model first, then apply one
snapshot. Do not add new peer-coordinate inference to `OnSize2`. Destroying or
hiding a window surface must explicitly transfer focus and must not terminate a
backend whose service owner remains active.

## Recovery and load projection

- Native recovery content is not selection authority. After lifecycle commit,
  prove that the Core contains exactly the expected single inactive recovered
  input, that `restoredInputId` and `effectiveActiveInputId` agree, then activate
  that exact ID and project one Core snapshot to the native surfaces.
- Core activation and native projection are distinct terminals. A failed active
  selection reports `CoreActivationFailed`; an invalid/hidden empty-editor
  projection reports `NativeProjectionFailed`. Startup fails closed and retains
  the durable backup in either case. Do not claim that this post-native-commit
  failure restores the pre-recovery native object graph.
- `CEditWnd::OnFinalLoad` owns the Core/UI finalization terminal for legacy file
  loads. Complete the pre-load persistence token only after Core adoption and
  native projection succeed. On projection failure or exception, fail-close the
  active Core input and retain the backup so native state is never published as
  an unrelated active workbench input.

## Phase 5 Live Workbench Projection

- Subscribe after the Workbench runtime is ready and before the initial layout
  snapshot is projected. The callback captures only the editor HWND and posts
  `MYWM_WORKBENCH_LAYOUT_CHANGED`; it never calls window objects or controls from
  the model callback thread.
- Reset the subscription before child-window teardown. A queued message after
  reset is stale and must be ignored. On a live notification, cancel any native
  drag and re-read the latest model snapshot on the UI thread.
- Validate Sidebar/Panel/Auxiliary Bar as one snapshot, then apply all three
  visibility/extent values. Projection failure preserves the last native state
  and is diagnostic; it is not permission to apply whichever fields happened to
  validate.
- Visibility toggles and splitter commits use fresh expected revisions and
  bounded non-wrapping operation IDs. Apply focus only after the accepted model
  snapshot has real visible native bounds.
- Runtime-backed windows mirror physical state into `CShareData` for legacy
  consumers but never hydrate physical layout from it. The no-runtime unit path
  may retain the historical shared-data behavior.
- The bounded native adapter projects committed built-in active surfaces for
  Explorer, Outline, Source Control, Terminal, Problems, Output, and the legacy
  extension-view Auxiliary Bar. Activation does not imply focus; an explicit
  coherent model focus is applied only after the projected native bounds exist.
  User-originated Outline expansion and bottom-panel tab selection first ask the
  model owner and may be vetoed; snapshot projection setters never call those
  request callbacks.
- Search, Run and Debug, the canonical Extensions view, Ports, Debug Console,
  arbitrary extension-owned views, move/reorder, and panel alignment still fail
  closed at this adapter boundary. They remain explicit Phase 5/6 gates and must
  not be approximated with legacy active-tool state.

## Phase 5 Native Command Route Checkpoint (2026-07-31)

- A runtime-backed window owns one `WorkbenchContextKeyService` and
  `WorkbenchCommandRegistry`. Destroy the registry/context before the native
  hosts captured by their executor callbacks.
- Explorer Activity Bar activation and legacy
  `F_TOGGLE_LEFT_EXPLORER` dispatch both execute
  `workbench.view.explorer`. Strip only the base 16-bit function code for alias
  comparison; preserve source/high-bit flags until that boundary.
- Once the registry recognizes a stable command, Disabled, Unsupported, Failed,
  or context-refresh failure is terminal and must not fall through to the
  historical native action.
- Native executors commit the layout/view model first and apply one validated
  current snapshot. The same snapshot refreshes core context keys; no local
  button selection or `CShareData` field may become a competing command state.
- Production OpenVSX receives
  `Bootstrap().UserDataProfile().SelectedProfileId()`, not the Control authority
  profile ID.
- Problems and Output native requests route through
  `workbench.actions.view.problems` and
  `workbench.action.output.toggleOutput`. Extension `OutputChannel.show` uses
  the show-only executor, so an already visible Output panel remains visible.
  Runtime-backed windows borrow the runtime Marker/Output services, subscribe
  through an HWND-only coalescing gate, and re-snapshot on the UI thread.
  Service callbacks never capture raw `CEditWnd`; teardown closes the gate and
  unsubscribes before destroying the panel or stopping the runtime.
- Problems and Output content is service-backed. Projection setters remain
  callback-free, Output selection mutates the model before local selection, and
  a `ChannelShown` change reveals Output while honoring `preserveFocus`.
  Legacy diagnostics repaint only current-document decorations and never become
  Problems authority.
- Problem activation currently opens the retained URI only. Applying its exact
  range is unsupported until a dedicated UTF-16-code-unit to Sakura-position
  adapter exists; do not approximate it with byte or display columns.

The integrated runtime/service/native-bridge cohort passes 210/210 and compiles
through the native window. Command Palette, arbitrary extension view
contributions, Debug Console, Ports, and Run and Debug still require production
wiring.
